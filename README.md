## Next Steps
* I want to add an "Email My To-Do List" Button, that will allow users to send their current to-do list to their email.

* I would improve task organization by adding categories or priority levels (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Urgent").
 
* I would also futher more improve task organization by creating a way to  users filter or sort tasks based on category or status.
